<td><div>Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today</div>
<div>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace</div>
<div>In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>That's the journey we're on today</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>We know the challenges</div>
<div>What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>The time for that politics is over</div>
<div>It's time to turn the page</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>I understand the skepticism</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>The market will fix it</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who taught me about hard work</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>Theirs are the stories that shaped me</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>That's the change we need right now</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>America, now is not the time for small plans</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>That's not the judgment we need</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>We are the party of Roosevelt</div>
<div>We are the party of Kennedy</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>These are the policies I will pursue</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>"We cannot walk alone," the preacher cried</div>
<div>"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>So I understand the cynicism</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>The world has changed</div>
<div>We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>Enough of the broken promises</div>
<div>Enough of the failed leadership</div>
<div>Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>It's called the Ownership Society in Washington</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And it's the easiest thing in the world</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>The time for our party's identity crisis is over</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>In just the last year, our own U.S</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate</div>
<div>It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>They fight the fight of our time</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax</div>
<div>Others, the plague</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>Outstanding career officials who run the Nunn-Lugar program -- people like Col</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>We all breathe the same air</div>

<td><div>Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>And it won't be easy</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support</div>
<div>And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>And that's to be expected</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>And I've seen it in this campaign</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things</div>
<div>They could've heard words of anger and discord</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save</div>
<div>Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And it's the easiest thing in the world</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears</div>
<div>And they want to believe again</div>
<div>And she began to cry</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>diplomatic, economic, and military </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>
<div>And it will be dangerous</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>I moved to Illinois over two decades ago</div>
<div>My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods</div>
<div>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken</div>
<div>That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>It's time to turn the page</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>But Washington has a long way to go</div>
<div>That's why we'll have to set priorities</div>
<div>We'll have to make hard choices</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>America, it's time to start bringing our troops home</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>Divided, we are bound to fail</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>Well it's time for them to own their failure</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>And that's to be expected</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>Change comes to Washington</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>Not with so much work to be done</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save</div>
<div>Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears</div>
<div>And they want to believe again</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>And she began to cry</div>
<div>When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing</div>
<div>I knew how to sew</div>
<div>I'm trying to go to college</div>
<div>I don't need to sew to go to college</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to make a mark on history</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>It cannot wait for other nations to act first</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>
<div>We need to see more</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace</div>
<div>In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>These challenges are not all of government's making</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>Out of work</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>We are the party of Roosevelt</div>
<div>We are the party of Kennedy</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>They could've heard words of anger and discord</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>Enough of the broken promises</div>
<div>Enough of the failed leadership</div>
<div>Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of that</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>They fight the fight of our time</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes</div>
<div>Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>But lately we haven't seen many of these visits</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>The time for that politics is over</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in words</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in conviction</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in hope</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>Theirs are the stories that shaped me</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>What is that promise</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>That won't keep America safe</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country</div>
<div>Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>That promise is our greatest inheritance</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>That together, our dreams can be one</div>
<div>"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of that</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>We all made this journey for a reason</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement</div>
<div>I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done</div>
<div>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>But Washington has a long way to go</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>I thought it was a tragic mistake</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>We are a better country than this</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>You make a big election about small things</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>It's a bracing idea</div>
<div>It's a tempting idea</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>My mother is a seamstress in a factory</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Our time to make a mark on history</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>But it was a magical trip</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>Corruption is not a new problem</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>Yet, a serious threat still remains</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>
<div>There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace</div>
<div>In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in words</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in conviction</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in hope</div>
<div>That's why I'm in this race</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>I'll invest in early childhood education</div>
<div>And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>And I've seen it in this campaign</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>It's called the Ownership Society in Washington</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And it's the easiest thing in the world</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding</div>
<div>My mother is a seamstress in a factory</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>In just the last year, our own U.S</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>We all made this journey for a reason</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken</div>
<div>That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before</div>
<div>In the face of secession, we unified a nation and set the captives free</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>We know the challenges</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>Divided, we are bound to fail</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>America, we are better than these last eight years</div>
<div>We are a better country than this</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>That's the change we need right now</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>That's not the judgment we need</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>We are the party of Roosevelt</div>
<div>We are the party of Kennedy</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>We all put our country first</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead</div>
<div>We cannot turn back."
America, we cannot turn back</div>
<div>America, we cannot turn back</div>
<div>We cannot walk alone</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>We know who we are</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>How can we explain this fact</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>We were in Ukraine, visiting a pathogen laboratory in Kiev</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>But lately we haven't seen many of these visits</div>
<div>We need to see more</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>We all breathe the same air</div>
<div>We all cherish our children's future</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>I moved to Illinois over two decades ago</div>
<div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement</div>
<div>I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>I thought it was a tragic mistake</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>I understand the skepticism</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>That's why I stand here tonight</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>I just think he doesn't know</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>These are the policies I will pursue</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>I get it</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>So I understand the cynicism</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>Because I think we've all had enough</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I think he loves his country</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing</div>
<div>I did not need sewing either</div>
<div>I knew how to sew</div>
<div>I don't need to sew to go to college</div>
<div>I hoped for something else."
I hoped for something else</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>We all made this journey for a reason</div>
<div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>We've talked about them for years</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>The time for that politics is over</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement</div>
<div>We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>Well it's time for them to own their failure</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>America, now is not the time for small plans</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook</div>
<div>So I've got news for you, John McCain</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>The time for our party's identity crisis is over</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership</div>
<div>They are longing for direction</div>
<div>I hoped for something else."
I hoped for something else</div>
<div>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>It cannot wait for other nations to act first</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>

<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>The time for that politics is over</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in words</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in conviction</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in hope</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>What is that promise</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>America, now is not the time for small plans</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>That promise is our greatest inheritance</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>We had held a large rally the night before in the Southside of Chicago, which is where I live</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>That's what America is</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>The time for our party's identity crisis is over</div>
<div>My mother is a seamstress in a factory</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>It is being threatened by corruption</div>
<div>Corruption is not a new problem</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>
<div>There is no doubt that there is a tough road ahead</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>America, it's time to start bringing our troops home</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>We all put our country first</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>That promise is our greatest inheritance</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>That together, our dreams can be one</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It ignores our history</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>The time for our party's identity crisis is over</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>We're tired of being divided, tired of running into ideological walls and partisan roadblocks, tired of appeals to our worst instincts and greatest fears</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time</div>
<div>Our time to make a mark on history</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>In just the last year, our own U.S</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>They fight the fight of our time</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>We all cherish our children's future</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>We all made this journey for a reason</div>
<div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement</div>
<div>And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Let us begin this hard work together</div>
<div>Let us transform this nation</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>Let's do this</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>
<div>This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>By ourselves, this change will not happen</div>
<div>That's why I'm in this race</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We are a better country than this</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>And I've seen it in this campaign</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And with this new world comes new risks and new dangers</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>Americans know this</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story</div>
<div>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Ladies and gentlemen, this is our time</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise</div>
<div>How can we explain this fact</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>So what explains this</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Among other things, this recognition resulted in the coalition that came to power in the December elections of 2002</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>This was two letters</div>
<div>Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''

<td><div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness - a certain audacity - to this announcement</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for justice and opportunity</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<td><div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>And it won't be easy</div>
<div>Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement</div>
<div>I thought it was a tragic mistake</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>It's because John McCain doesn't get it</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>The market will fix it</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>It should help us, not hurt us</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>I get it</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>Because I've seen it</div>
<div>Because I've lived it</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>And I've seen it in this campaign</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>It doesn't work</div>
<div>It ignores our history</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>But it was a magical trip</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>It cannot wait for other nations to act first</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>It is being threatened by corruption</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>It stifles innovation and fractures the fabric of the society</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites</div>
<div>It will be difficult</div>
<div>And it will be dangerous</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''

<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>
<div>You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>So I've got news for you, John McCain</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>You make a big election about small things</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>It's been about you</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America</div>
<div> Thank you</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>

<td><div>That's the journey we're on today</div>
<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>We welcomed immigrants to our shores, we opened railroads to the west, we landed a man on the moon, and we heard a King's call to let justice roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>You're on your own</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Our time to make a mark on history</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>

<td><div>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>By ourselves, this change will not happen</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>The market will fix it</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the start-ups that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>I will end this war in Iraq responsibly, and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan</div>
<div>I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>These are the policies I will pursue</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party that will harness homegrown, alternative fuels and spur the production of fuel-efficient, hybrid cars to break our dependence on the world's most dangerous regimes</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country</div>
<div>Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>It will be difficult</div>
<div>And it will be dangerous</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace</div>
<div>In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done</div>
<div>And it won't be easy</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that ends poverty in America</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>This campaign must be the occasion, the vehicle, of your hopes, and your dreams</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>And that's to be expected</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>That together, our dreams can be one</div>
<div>Not with so much work to be done</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>
<div>It will be difficult</div>
<div>And it will be dangerous</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>Divided, we are bound to fail</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>These challenges are not all of government's making</div>
<div>America, we are better than these last eight years</div>
<div>We are a better country than this</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>These are not whiners</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>These are my heroes</div>
<div>Theirs are the stories that shaped me</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>We are the party of Roosevelt</div>
<div>We are the party of Kennedy</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>These are the policies I will pursue</div>
<div>The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>We know who we are</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>

<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>Americans everywhere are desperate for leadership</div>
<div>They are longing for direction</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>But elections are not enough</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>

<div>The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>

<td><div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>And as our economy changes, let's be the generation that ensures our nation's workers are sharing in our prosperity</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>

<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>As President, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>Another girl, Mireya, listened as her friend told this story</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>And, as Frederick Douglass once stated: "Power concedes nothing without a demand</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>As the Avian Influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous Russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>But Washington has a long way to go</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W</div>
<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>But there's just one problem</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>But it was a magical trip</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>But, Kenya must do its part</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>But elections are not enough</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>But lately we haven't seen many of these visits</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who taught me about hard work</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>We know who we are</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>

<td><div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>That's why we'll have to set priorities</div>
<div>We'll have to make hard choices</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>That we have individual responsibility, but we also have collective responsibility to each other</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>In the face of war, you believe there can be peace</div>
<div>In the face of despair, you believe there can be hope</div>
<div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>That together, our dreams can be one</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>How can we explain this fact</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>
<div>You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result</div>
<div>Not with so much work to be done</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save</div>
<div>Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>

<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>The party who believes that in this democracy, influence and access should begin and end with the power of the ballot</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>

<td><div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>Let's recruit a new army of teachers, and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>We can harness homegrown, alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuel-efficient cars</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support</div>
<div>And in exchange, I'll ask for higher standards and more accountability</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Of course, the best way to reduce bureaucracy and increase pay is to create more private sector jobs</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>And it means more sustained engagement, including more senior-level visits to Nunn-Lugar program sites</div>
<div>We need to see more</div>

<td><div>In the face of a politics that's shut you out, that's told you to settle, that's divided us for too long, you believe we can be one people, reaching for what's possible, building that more perfect union</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>So let us begin</div>
<div>Let us begin this hard work together</div>
<div>Let us transform this nation</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>But the life of a tall, gangly, self-made Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in words</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in conviction</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in hope</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>It should help us, not hurt us</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<div>It's not because John McCain doesn't care</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>It should help us, not hurt us</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>Not even close</div>

<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>That's not the judgment we need</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>

<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>I did not need sewing either</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>Corruption is not a new problem</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>But elections are not enough</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>But I will also renew the tough, direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>It suffers from the legacy of colonialism, of national boundaries that were drawn without regard to the political and tribal alignments of indigenous peoples, and that therefore fed conflict and tribal strife</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>First, the Nunn-Lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from Soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout Russia and the Independent States</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>That's why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate</div>
<div>I thought it was a tragic mistake</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>The first was in hairstyling; the other in braiding</div>
<div>When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>But it was a magical trip</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union was engaged in a massive undertaking in the field of germ warfare</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>This was two letters</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>

<div>We all made this journey for a reason</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>Let's make college more affordable, and let's invest in scientific research, and let's lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>I want to win that next battle - for better schools, and better jobs, and health care for all</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>These challenges are not all of government's making</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95% of all working families</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>We all put our country first</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>Because I think we've all had enough</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>Will all her childhood hopes be fulfilled</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>
<div>We all breathe the same air</div>
<div>We all cherish our children's future</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>It is rooted in the bankrupt idea that the goal of politics or business is to funnel as much of the pie as possible to one's family, tribe, or circle with little regard for the public good</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>For a scientist or other employee to simply walk out of the lab with enough material to construct a weapon of mass destruction is far too easy, and the consequences would be far too devastating</div>

<td><div>Each and every time, a new generation has risen up and done what's needed to be done</div>
<div>But Washington has a long way to go</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The world has changed</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>But it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, of mutual responsibility</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Finally, ethnic-based tribal politics has to stop</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>That's what Abraham Lincoln understood</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>Most of all, let's be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything we've got</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>What is that promise</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do</div>
<div>That's what America is</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>So what explains this</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>a willingness on the part of each of us to look past what is petty and small and sensational, and look ahead to what is necessary and purposeful</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>
<div>And we are all mortal.''
Much of what President Kennedy described in 1963 remains true to this day - and we owe it to ourselves and our children to get it right</div>

<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>But through his will and his words, he moved a nation and helped free a people</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>That beneath all the differences of race and region, faith and station, we are one people</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>The history of Africa is a history of ancient kingdoms and great traditions; the story of people fighting to be free from colonial rule; the heroism of not only of great men like Nkrumah and Kenyatta and Mandela, but also ordinary people who endured great hardship, from Ghana to South Africa, to secure self-determination in the face of great odds</div>
<div>A foreign policy that gives hope and opportunity to the people of this great continent</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>Instead of opening businesses and engaging in commerce, people come to rely on patronage and payback as a means of advancing</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>

<td><div>Let me begin by saying thanks to all you who've traveled, from far and wide, to brave the cold today</div>
<div>And I accepted the job, sight unseen, motivated then by a single, simple, powerful idea - that I might play a small part in building a better America</div>
<div>I joined with pastors and lay-people to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings</div>
<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>We can control costs by focusing on prevention, by providing better treatment to the chronically ill, and using technology to cut the bureaucracy</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>That's why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of 2008</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>By ourselves, this change will not happen</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>It is being threatened by corruption</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>They could've heard words of anger and discord</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>They are longing for direction</div>
<div>And they want to believe again</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>

<div>They fight the fight of our time</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>While they are often difficult to use, they are easy to transport, hard to detect, and, as we saw in Kiev, not always well secured</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>

<div>Let's protect the hard-earned benefits their companies have promised</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty</div>
<div>Well it's time for them to own their failure</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>

<div>My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods</div>
<div>It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had, and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>

<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>These are my heroes</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>

<div>I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>My mother is a seamstress in a factory</div>
<div>My mother sews</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>

<td><div>We've talked about them for years</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Finally, there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war - and that is the homecoming of the men and women - our veterans - who have sacrificed the most</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She's the one who taught me about hard work</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>You make a big election about small things</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>It's been about you</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>Doesn't he want to see this?" I found him standing about fifteen feet away, all the way in the back of the room</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>But thinking of the Russians more as partners does mean being more thoughtful, respectful, and consistent about what we say and what we do</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>I remember when I first ran for the state Senate - my very first race</div>
<div>Well, I thought about it, and then I did what every wise man does when faced with a difficult decision: I prayed, and I asked my wife</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>When asked what was wrong, she said, "I don't want to take hairdressing</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>When we went upcountry, we traveled by train and matatu, with chickens and collard greens and sometimes babies placed in my lap</div>
<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>Time and time again on the trip, I saw their skill and experience when negotiating with the Russians</div>

<div>But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>Well it's time for them to own their failure</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>In that time, he's said no to higher fuel-efficiency standards for cars, no to investments in renewable energy, no to renewable fuels</div>
<div>Now is the time to end this addiction, and to understand that drilling is a stop-gap measure, not a long-term solution</div>
<div>America, now is not the time for small plans</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>

<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>

<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>That together, our dreams can be one</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>But there's just one problem</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>It can shield a war criminal - even one like Felicien Kabuga, suspected of helping to finance and orchestrate the Rwandan genocide - by allowing him to purchase safe haven for a time and robbing all humanity of the opportunity to bring the criminal to justice</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>One final point</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>As most of you know, I am not a native of this great state</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>I know I haven't spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington</div>
<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>We know the challenges</div>
<div>And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the void</div>
<div>Most of you know I opposed this war from the start</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>I just think he doesn't know</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>Americans know this</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>We know who we are</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>We know that the temptation to take a bribe is greater when you're not making enough on the job</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>

<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time, a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>

<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>

<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>I slept on the couch of my sister's apartment, not a fancy hotel, and often took my meals at a small tea-house in downtown Nairobi</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>Inside, staring right at us, were rows upon rows of test tubes</div>
<div>At this point I turned around and said "Hey, where's Lugar</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>I just think he doesn't know</div>
<div>Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>You know, we all remember that George Bush said in 2000 campaign that he was against nation-building</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>

<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>

<div>And we should take heart, because we've changed this country before</div>
<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>

<div>It's because John McCain doesn't get it</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>

<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>Because I've seen it</div>
<div>Because I've lived it</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>Because I think we've all had enough</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>

<div>Americans were originally persuaded by the President to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were </div>

<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We are a better country than this</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>Because next week, in Minnesota, the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>The Republican nominee, John McCain, has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction, and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect</div>
<div>You see, we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>We all put our country first</div>
<div>We may not agree on abortion, but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>I think he loves his country</div>
<div>The idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we're all in it together and everybody's got a shot at opportunity</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Will she see greater opportunities for every citizen of this country</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>We know as well the talent, the intelligence, and the creativity that exists in this country</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>I know that while recent reports have pointed to strong economic growth in this country, 56% of Kenyans still live in poverty</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>Instead of unifying the country to move forward on solving problems, it divides neighbor from neighbor</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>

<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last, best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace</div>

<div>He tells us that there is power in conviction</div>
<div>He tells us that there is power in hope</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>I know there are differences on same-sex marriage, but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>

<div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose - our sense of higher purpose</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>It's been about you</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>Our faith has been shaken, but the people running Washington aren't willing to make us believe again</div>
<div>But in our past there has been another term for it - Social Darwinism - every man or women for him or herself</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>

<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>She poured everything she had into me</div>
<div>And although she can no longer travel, I know that she's watching tonight, and that tonight is her night as well</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>That she was born at a time for black folks when lynchings were not uncommon, but voting was</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And I thought about how she saw women finally win the right to vote</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>She believed in this idea with all her heart and she saw this progress around her and she had faith that someday it would be her turn</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>And she saw young people of every race and every creed take a bus down to Mississippi and Alabama to register voters because they believed</div>
<div>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation</div>
<div>And at last - at last - she saw the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>She kept on voting in each and every election because she believed</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>

<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>

<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>

<div>At one point, Kozol tells about his trip to Fremont High School in Los Angeles, where he met a girl who tells him that she'd taken hairdressing twice, because there were actually two different levels offered by the high school</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>I learned that my grandfather had been a cook for the British and, although he was a respected elder in his village, he was called "boy" by his employers for most of his life</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>

<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>America, we are better than these last eight years</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>America, now is not the time for small plans</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave, because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>That won't keep America safe</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>They have not served a Red America or a Blue America - they have served the United States of America</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>But what the people heard instead - people of every creed and color, from every walk of life - is that in America, our destiny is inextricably linked</div>
<div>We cannot turn back."
America, we cannot turn back</div>
<div>America, we cannot turn back</div>
<div>Thank you, and God Bless the United States of America</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>Never again can we expect the oceans that surround America to keep us safe from attacks on our own soil</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>That's what America is</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America found its way</div>
<div>They can say that this was the time when America learned to dream again.</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>

<td><div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>So let us begin</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>To the love of my life, our next First Lady, Michelle Obama, and to Sasha and Malia - I love you so much, and I'm so proud of all of you</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>She's the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>So don't tell me that Democrats won't defend this country</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>So I've got news for you, John McCain</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>Not with so much work to be done</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend</div>
<div>So I understand the cynicism</div>
<div>And so I said fine, and I met her, and we talked</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>My sister, Auma, was teaching that year at this university, and so I came to stay with her for a month</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>So what explains this</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>It stacks the deck so high against entrepreneurs that they cannot get their job-creating ideas off the ground</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>

<div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>In the face of Depression, we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty</div>
<div>Let us begin this hard work together</div>
<div>Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job, and earn a living wage that can pay the bills, and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work</div>
<div>Politics doesn't have to divide us on this anymore - we can work together to keep our country safe</div>
<div>We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military, we can tighten the net around their finances, and we can improve our intelligence capabilities</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>And if you will join me in this improbable quest, if you feel destiny calling, and see as I see, a future of endless possibility stretching before us; if you sense, as I sense, that the time is now to shake off our slumber, and slough off our fear, and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations, then I'm ready to take up the cause, and march with you, and work with you</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint</div>
<div>Out of work</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>She's the one who taught me about hard work</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>America, our work will not be easy</div>
<div>When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>Not with so much work to be done</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>It doesn't work</div>

<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>I believe there a number of factors at work</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>And we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction</div>

<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>And let's allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this country's middle-class again</div>
<div>We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases</div>
<div>I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union, and building a better America</div>

<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>You can't truly stand up for Georgia when you've strained our oldest alliances</div>
<div>For eighteen long months, you have stood up, one by one, and said enough to the politics of the past</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>In the Republicans who never thought they'd pick up a Democratic ballot, but did</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>I went to bake sales and barber shops and if there were two guys standing on the corner I'd pull up and hand them literature</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>And she saw people lining up to vote for the first time - and she got in that line - and she never forgot it</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>I learned how my father had grown up in a tiny village called Alego, near Siaya, during this period of tumult</div>
<div>And yet, I discovered that for all his education, my father's life ended up being filled with disappointments</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>Our guide then brought us right up to what looked like a mini-refrigerator</div>
<div>She picked them up, clanked them around, and we listened to the translator explain what she was saying</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>

<div>I was a young man then, just a year out of college; I knew no one in Chicago, was without money or family connections</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>I just think he doesn't know</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>They claim that our insistence on something larger, something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>And everywhere I went I'd get two questions:
First, they'd ask, "Where'd you get that funny name, Barack Obama?" Because people just couldn't pronounce it</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>We just didn't know he was talking about this one</div>
<div>But there's just one problem</div>
<div>And so I am eager to have this argument not just with the President, but the entire Republican Party over what this country is about</div>
<div>And in the end, we know that it isn't enough to just say that you've had enough</div>
<div>The party that won't just throw a few tax breaks at families who can't afford their insurance, but modernizes our health care system and gives every family a chance to buy insurance at a price they can afford</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>

<div>When African nations were just gaining independence, industrialized nations had decades of experience building their domestic economies and navigating the international financial system</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>In just the last year, our own U.S</div>
<div>When people are judged by merit, not connections, then the best and brightest can lead the country, people will work hard, and the entire economy will grow - everyone will benefit and more resources will be available for all, not just select groups</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>

<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>As our parents' children, we have the opportunity to learn from these mistakes and disappointments</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>The answers to these questions will require sustained involvement by the Executive Branch, Congress, non-governmental organizations, and the international community</div>
<div>Many of these aging research facilities have the largest, least secure quantities of highly enriched uranium in the world - the quickest way to a nuclear weapon</div>
<div>Not to mention the environmental and public health and safety catastrophe that could come from a failure to store and transport these materials safely and securely</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>By destroying these inventories, this is one place we could be making more of a difference</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>Right now, there are forces within the former Soviet Union and elsewhere that want these non-proliferation programs to stop</div>
<div>Our detention for three hours in Perm is a testament to these forces</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>We must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>
<div>It's important for senior officials to go and visit these sites, to check their progress and shortcomings; to see what's working and what's not</div>
<div>But lately we haven't seen many of these visits</div>

<td><div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>All of us running for president will travel around the country offering ten-point plans and making grand speeches; all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>For over two decades, he's subscribed to that old, discredited Republican philosophy - give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk</div>
<div>America, this is one of those moments</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord</div>
<div>It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg</div>
<div>It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>"Let us not be blind to our differences--but let us also direct attention to our common interests and to the means by which those differences can be resolved...For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet</div>

<td><div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>In the face of tyranny, a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation, and job creation, and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world</div>
<div>But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq</div>
<div>Not just to hold an office, but to gather with you to transform a nation</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>And I'll invest 150 billion dollars over the next decade in affordable, renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>I'll recruit an army of new teachers, and pay them higher salaries and give them more support</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>How she saw unions rise up and a middle-class prosper, and watched immigrants leave distant shores in search of an idea known as America</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>This lack of access for Africa's agriculture and commodities has restricted an important engine of economic growth</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>

<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet</div>
<div>More of you have cars you can't afford to drive, credit card bills you can't afford to pay, and tuition that's beyond your reach</div>
<div>Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society, but what it really means is - you're on your own</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>You're on your own</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>If you have health care, my plan will lower your premiums</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>If you don't have a record to run on, then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>It allows us to say to the child who didn't have the foresight to choose the right parents or be born in the right suburb - pick yourself up by your bootstraps</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>I wish all of you luck in finding this courage in the days and months to come, and I want you to know that as your ally, your friend, and your brother, I will be there to help in any way I can</div>

<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It's time to turn the page</div>
<div>America, it's time to start bringing our troops home</div>

<div>It's not because John McCain doesn't care</div>
<div>It's because John McCain doesn't get it</div>
<div>Well it's time for them to own their failure</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>And you know what - it's worked before</div>
<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>It's been about you</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>It's a time where you can go to any town hall or street corner or coffee shop and hear people express the same anxiety about the future; hear them convey the same uncertainty about the direction we're headed as a country</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>Well it's time we finally said we notice, and we care, and we're not gonna settle anymore</div>
<div>The problem isn't that their philosophy isn't working the way it's supposed to - it's that it is</div>
<div>It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do</div>
<div>It's called the Ownership Society in Washington</div>
<div>It's a bracing idea</div>
<div>It's a tempting idea</div>
<div>And it's the easiest thing in the world</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>It makes it impossible to respond effectively to crises -- whether it's the HIV/AIDS pandemic or malaria or crippling drought</div>

<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>Because if you don't have any fresh ideas, then you use stale tactics to scare the voters</div>

<div>If your hopes have been dashed again and again, then it's best to stop hoping, and settle for what you already know</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>

<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>And then someday, someday, if our kids get the chance to stand where we are and look back at the beginning of the 21st century, they can say that this was the time when America renewed its purpose</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>You will decide if your leaders will be held accountable, or if you will look the other way</div>
<div>You will decide if the standards and the rules will be the same for everyone - regardless of ethnicity or of wealth</div>

<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States</div>
<div>What is that promise</div>
<div>It's a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will, but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal day's work, because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>This too is part of America's promise - the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>That promise is our greatest inheritance</div>
<div>It's a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night, and a promise that you make to yours - a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west; a promise that led workers to picket lines, and women to reach for the ballot</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>One statistic powerfully describes this unfulfilled promise</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>We have the opportunity to muster the courage to fulfill the promise of our forefathers and lead our great nations towards a better future</div>

<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps - even if you don't have boots</div>
<div>I don't know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead, but this has been mine</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>If you don't, you'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>You don't defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq</div>
<div>You don't protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington</div>

<div>Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe</div>

<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>

<td><div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed</div>
<div>The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Our government should work for us, not against us</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>The sweeping changes brought by revolutions in technology have torn down walls between business and government and people and places all over the globe</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>We know that government can't solve all our problems - and we don't want it to</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>An accountable, transparent government can break this cycle</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>

<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>That's the change we need right now</div>
<div>Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament, and judgment, to serve as the next Commander-in-Chief, that's a debate I'm ready to have</div>
<div>That's not the judgment we need</div>
<div>And that's what we have to restore</div>
<div>And that's to be expected</div>

<div>We have the most powerful military on Earth, but that's not what makes us strong</div>
<div>Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world, but that's not what keeps the world coming to our shores</div>
<div>Who said we're going to keep on dreaming, and we're going to keep on building, and we're going to keep on marching, and we're going to keep on working because that's who we are</div>
<div>It's the timidity - the smallness - of our politics that's holding us back right now</div>
<div>That's what America is</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>The party that's not bought and paid for by the oil companies</div>
<div>You enjoy a robust civil society; a press that's free, fair, and honest; and a strong partnership with my own country that has resulted in critical cooperation on terrorist issues, real strides in fighting disease and poverty, and an important alliance on fostering regional stability</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>

<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>

<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of that</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>

<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>

<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>

<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>
<div>Right now, rogue states and despotic regimes are looking to begin or accelerate their own nuclear programs</div>

<td><div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>It's time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone else's civil war</div>
<div>It is that promise that has always set this country apart - that through hard work and sacrifice, each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family, to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>
<div>Tonight, I say to the American people, to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land - enough</div>
<div>This moment - this election - is our chance to keep, in the 21st century, the American promise alive</div>
<div>We measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President - when the average American family saw its income go up $7,500 instead of down $2,000 like it has under George Bush</div>
<div>It's a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth, but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs, look out for American workers, and play by the rules of the road</div>
<div>It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>I'll make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars</div>
<div>And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country, we will make sure you can afford a college education</div>
<div>Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable, accessible health care for every single American</div>
<div>Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>That in a global economy that's more connected and more competitive - we are the party that will guarantee every American an affordable, world-class, top-notch, life-long education - from early childhood to high school, from college to on-the-job training</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>Our time to write a new chapter in the American story</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>A few Tuesdays ago, the American people embraced this seriousness with regards to America’s policy in Iraq</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<td><div>After three years of this work, I went to law school, because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need</div>
<div>We've talked about them for years</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>Four years ago, I stood before you and told you my story - of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who weren't well-off or well-known, but shared a belief that in America, their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to</div>
<div>Because for two hundred and thirty two years, at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy, ordinary men and women - students and soldiers, farmers and teachers, nurses and janitors -- found the courage to keep it alive</div>
<div>America, we are better than these last eight years</div>
<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business, I think about my grandmother, who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middle-management, despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman</div>
<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>Washington's been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years, and John McCain has been there for twenty-six of them</div>
<div>For part of what has been lost these past eight years can't just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>That even though we may get involved out of civic obligation every few years, we don't always have confidence that government can make a difference in our lives</div>
<div>And all of this would have been unremarkable except for the fact that this woman, Marguerite Lewis, was born in 1899 and was 105 years old</div>
<div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>I had just finished three years of work as a community organizer in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago, and was about to enroll in law school</div>
<div>Instead of a motorcade, we traveled in my sister's old VW Beetle, which even then was already ten years old</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>For years, Nunn-Lugar programs have been effectively upgrading security at sites in six countries across the former Soviet Union</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>

<div>I know there are those who don't believe we can do all these things</div>
<div>It must be about us - it must be about what we can do together</div>
<div>How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement</div>
<div>Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems, but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves - protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education; keep our water clean and our toys safe; invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology</div>
<div>Because in an economy like this, the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle-class</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes</div>
<div>I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>It's that it's doing exactly what it's supposed to do</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>If we do all this, if we can be trusted to lead, this will not be a Democratic Agenda, it will be an American agenda</div>
<div>And, I will do my part to shape an intelligent foreign policy that promotes peace and prosperity</div>
<div>But, Kenya must do its part</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>In the end, if the people cannot trust their government to do the job for which it exists - to protect them and to promote their common welfare - all else is lost</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>

<div>It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided, North and South, slave and free</div>

<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>She believed that over a span of three centuries, she had seen enough to know that there is no challenge too great, no injustice too crippling, no destiny too far out of reach for America</div>
<div>No longer can we assume that a high-school education is enough to compete for a job that could easily go to a college-educated student in Bangalore or Beijing</div>
<div>No more can we count on employers to provide health care and pensions and job training when their bottom-lines know no borders</div>
<div>That if you give a speech where you rattle off statistics about the stock market being up and orders for durable goods being on the rise, no one will notice the single mom whose two jobs won't pay the bills or the student who can't afford his college dreams</div>
<div>That if you say the words "plan for victory" and point to the number of schools painted and roads paved and cell phones used in Iraq, no one will notice the nearly 2,500 flag-draped coffins that have arrived at Dover Air Force base</div>
<div>And on a more personal level, because he never fully reconciled the traditions of his village with more modern conceptions of family - because he related to women as his father had, expecting them to obey him no matter what he did - his family life was unstable, and his children never knew him well</div>
<div>There is no doubt that what Kenyans have accomplished with this independence is both impressive and inspiring</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>We entered through no fences or discernible security, and once we did, we found ourselves in a building with open first-floor windows and padlocks that many of us would not use to secure our own luggage</div>

<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for $13,000 a year</div>
<div>My work took me to some of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods</div>
<div>That is why this campaign can't only be about me</div>

<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>She's the one who taught me about hard work</div>
<div>She poured everything she had into me</div>
<div>Theirs are the stories that shaped me</div>

<div>Don't tell me that Democrats won't keep us safe</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>And the second thing people would ask me was, "You seem like a nice young man</div>
<div>But whenever I get in that mood, I think about something that happened to me on the eve of my election to the United States Senate</div>
<div>And in the midst of this rally, someone comes up to me and says that there's a woman who'd like to come meet you, and she's traveled a long way and she wants to take a picture and shake your hand</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>And most importantly for me, I discovered the story of my father's life, and the story of his father before him</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>

<div>They'd call me "Alabama," or they'd call me "Yo Mama." And I'd have to explain that I got the name from my father, who was from Kenya</div>
<div>The first time I came to Kenya was in 1987</div>
<div>To begin with, I discovered the warmth and sense of community that the people of Kenya possess - their sense of hopefulness even in the face of great difficulty</div>
<div>I began to understand and appreciate the distance he had traveled - from being a boy herding goats to a student at the University of Hawaii and Harvard University to the respected economist that he was upon his return to Kenya</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>In early 1960's, as Kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of South Korea</div>
<div>Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>Third, Kenya is hurt from factors unique to Africa's geography and place in the world -- disease, distance from viable markets and especially terms of trade</div>
<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>But, Kenya must do its part</div>
<div>The hard truth is that nations, by and large, will act in their self-interest and if Kenya does not act, it will fall behind</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>And you will determine the direction of this country in the 21st century - whether the hard work of the many is lost to the selfish desires of a few, or whether you build an open, honest, stronger Kenya where everyone rises together</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>As I said at the outset, I did not know my father well - he returned to Kenya from America when I was still young</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>

<td><div>It's humbling, but in my heart I know you didn't come here just for me, you came here because you believe in what this country can be</div>
<div>But let me tell you how I came to be here</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where I saw all that is America converge - farmers and teachers, businessmen and laborers, all of them with a story to tell, all of them seeking a seat at the table, all of them clamoring to be heard</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable - that it's possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised; and that so long as we're willing to listen to each other, we can assume the best in people instead of the worst</div>
<div>It was here, in Springfield, where North, South, East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people - where I came to believe that through this decency, we can build a more hopeful America</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that says right here, right now, that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next president's first term</div>
<div>Let's be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>That's why I stand here tonight</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>Unlike John McCain, I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas, and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America</div>
<div>I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America</div>
<div>Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I think old Newt is onto something here</div>
<div>We are here tonight because we believe that in this country, we have it within our power to say "yes" to those questions - to forge our own destiny - to begin the world anew</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>The good news is that there are already signs of progress here</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>Since that time I have known him through stories - those my mother would tell and those I heard from my relatives here in Kenya on my last trip to this country</div>
<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>Jim Reid and Andy Weber who are here this morning -- will be there every step of the way to ensure that U.S</div>

<div>So let us begin</div>

<div>Let us transform this nation</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age</div>
<div>But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>Let us be the generation that begins this work</div>
<div>It will take your time, your energy, and your advice - to push us forward when we're doing right, and to let us know when we're not</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight</div>
<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>So let us agree that patriotism has no party</div>
<div>Let us keep that promise - that American promise - and in the words of Scripture hold firmly, without wavering, to the hope that we confess</div>
<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>Don't let anyone tell you we don't know what we stand for and don't doubt it yourselves</div>
<div>So let it be said that we are the party of opportunity</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of an energy independent America</div>
<div>Let it be said that we will conduct a smart foreign policy that battles the forces of terrorism and fundamentalism wherever they may exist by matching the might of our military with the power of our diplomacy and the strength of our alliances</div>
<div>And when we do go to war, let us always be honest with the American people about why we are there and how we will win</div>
<div>And let it be said that we are the party of open, honest government that doesn't peddle the agenda of whichever lobbyist or special interest can write the biggest check</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>

<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage; whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>The men and women who gathered there could've heard many things</div>
<div>They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred</div>
<div>Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for</div>
<div>Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend</div>
<div>That she was born under the cloud of Jim Crow, free in theory but still enslaved in so many ways</div>
<div>I learned about the brutal repression of Operation Anvil, the days of rape and torture in the "Pipeline" camps, the lives that so many gave, and how my grandfather had been arrested briefly during this period, despite being at the periphery of Kenya's liberation struggles</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>His ideas about how Kenya should progress often put him at odds with the politics of tribe and patronage, and because he spoke his mind, sometimes to a fault, he ended up being fired from his job and prevented from finding work in the country for many, many years</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>Kenya, like many African nations did not come of age under the best historical circumstances</div>
<div>It never did, and it never will." As a result, many African nations have been asked to liberalize their markets without reciprocal concessions from mature economies</div>
<div>Like many nations across this continent, where Kenya is failing is in its ability to create a government that is transparent and accountable</div>
<div>Among African nations, Kenya remains a model for representative democracy - a place where many different ethnic factions have found a way to live and work together in peace and stability</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>

<div>That's why we were able to give health insurance to children in need</div>
<div>And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need, more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>
<div>Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>That's the promise we need to keep</div>
<div>That's the change we need right now</div>
<div>And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer, I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most</div>
<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>That's not the judgment we need</div>
<div>We need a President who can face the threats of the future, not keep grasping at the ideas of the past</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>The challenges we face require tough choices, and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the worn-out ideas and politics of the past</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>I did not need sewing either</div>
<div>I don't need to sew to go to college</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>
<div>We need to be sure that Nunn-Lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>We need to see more</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>

<div>This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment he's worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China, and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news</div>
<div>We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes</div>

<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gang-violence in Cleveland, but don't tell me we can't uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AK-47s out of the hands of criminals</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>It allows us to say to those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford - life isn't fair</div>
<div>Will she see a country that is freer and kinder, more tolerant and more just than the one she grew up in</div>
<div>Our time to leave our children a country that is freer and kinder, more prosperous and more just than the place we grew up</div>
<div>My experience then was very different than it has been on this trip</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>It's more than just history and outside influences that explain why Kenya lags behind</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>By focusing on building strong, independent institutions - like an anti-corruption commission with real authority - rather than cults of personality, they make a contribution to their country that will last longer than their own lives</div>
<div>I know that honoring their memory and making that freedom real may seem like an impossible task - an effort bigger than you can imagine - but sometimes all it takes to move us there is doing what little you can to right the wrongs you see</div>
<div>In today's Kenya - a Kenya already more open and less repressive than in my father's day - it is that courage that will bring the reform so many of you so desperately want and deserve</div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>

<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>

<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>
<div>It lets us say to the guy who worked twenty or thirty years in the factory and then watched his plant move out to Mexico or China - we're sorry, but you're on your own</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>So if the government found ways to downsize the bureaucracy - to cut out the positions that aren't necessary or useful - it could use the extra money to increase the salary of other government officials</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>Looking out at this crowd of young people, I have faith that you will fight this fight too</div>

<div>Certainly it is not due to lack of effort on the part of ordinary Kenyans - we know how hard Kenyans are willing to work, the tremendous sacrifices that Kenyan mothers make for their children, the Herculean efforts that Kenyan fathers make for their families</div>
<div>And we know how much this land is blessed - just as the entire African continent is blessed - with great gifts and riches</div>
<div>In a true democracy, it is what happens between elections that is the true measure of how a government treats its people</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>Wealth declarations do little good if no one can access them, and accountability in government spending is not possible if no one knows how much was available and allocated to a given project in the first place</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>

<div>We've made some progress already</div>
<div>Each of us, in our own lives, will have to accept responsibility - for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children, for adapting to a more competitive economy, for strengthening our communities, and sharing some measure of sacrifice</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>And I will not settle for an America where some kids don't have that chance</div>
<div>The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents, but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag</div>
<div>A seat had opened up, and some friends asked me if I'd be interested in running</div>
<div>She believed that we don't have to settle for equality for some or opportunity for the lucky or freedom for the few</div>
<div>The idea that some problems are just too big to handle, and if you just ignore them, sooner or later, they'll go away</div>
<div>But we also know that there are some things we can't do on our own</div>
<div>We know that there are some things we do better together</div>
<div>When it broke down in front of Uhuru Park, we had to push until some joakalis came to fix it by the side of the road</div>
<div>In many ways, then, my family's life reflects some of the contradictions of Kenya, and indeed, the African continent as a whole</div>
<div>It's a human problem, and it has existed in some form in almost every society</div>
<div>My own city of Chicago has been the home of some of the most corrupt local politics in American history, from patronage machines to questionable elections</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>But there are so many others, some of whom I'm meeting during my visit here - Betty Murungi, Ken Njau, Jane Onyango, Maina Kiai, Milly Odhiombo, and Hussein Khalid</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>Some of the tubes, he said, were filled with anthrax</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>At its height in the late 1980's, this program stockpiled of some of the most dangerous agents known to man - plague, smallpox, and anthrax - to name just a few</div>
<div>Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>

<div>Here in Washington, we saw what happened when just two letters filled with just a few grams of Anthrax were sent to the U.S</div>
<div>Five postal employees were killed and the Senate office buildings were closed for months</div>

<div>Enough of the broken promises</div>
<div>Enough of the failed leadership</div>
<div>Enough of the can't-do, won't-do, won't-even-try style of governance</div>

<div>We've talked about them for years</div>
<div>Let's set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed</div>

<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>

<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>

<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>This is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the Soviet biological weapons program</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>But this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater</div>
<div>And as we speak, members of Al Qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>My third recommendation - which I'll just touch briefly on and let Senator Lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons</div>
<div>On our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders</div>
<div>In Donetsk, I stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled</div>
<div>While the government of Ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>

<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>

<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>Other issues, such as resource extraction and the drain of human capital have also been major factors</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>And we also know that the more people there are on the government payroll, the more likely it is that someone will be encouraged to take a bribe</div>
<div>As one book says, "disease by the ton was its industry."
Besides the devastation they can cause to a civilian population, biological agents can also be effective in asymmetrical warfare against U.S</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>I also saw their ability to ensure that shortcomings were addressed and programs were implemented correctly</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>

<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>And that is why, in the shadow of the Old State Capitol, where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together, where common hopes and common dreams still, I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States</div>
<div>Today we are called once more - and it is time for our generation to answer that call</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>All of us know what those challenges are today - a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can</div>
<div>They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back</div>
<div>Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones, the hearts that have been broken, and the young lives that could have been</div>
<div>As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery, he was heard to say: "Of strange, discordant, and even hostile elements, we gathered from the four winds, and formed and fought to battle through."
That is our purpose here today</div>
<div>Together, starting today, let us finish the work that needs to be done, and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth.</div>
<div>And today, we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>Thank you Roger Hickey and Bob Borosage for bringing us all together today and thank you for your leadership in the cause of a more progressive America</div>
<div>My friends, we meet here today at a time where we find ourselves at a crossroads in America's history</div>
<div>You teach law school, you're a civil rights attorney, you organize voter registration, you're a family man - why would you wanna go into something dirty and nasty like politics?"
And I understood the question because it revealed the cynicism people feel about public life today</div>
<div>And I think that we face one of those moments today</div>
<div>Today, South Korea's economy is forty times larger than Kenya's</div>
<div>And yet, the reason I speak of the freedom that you fought so hard to win is because today that freedom is in jeopardy</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>This is the Kenya that so many who came before you envisioned - all those men and women who struggled and sacrificed and fought for the freedom you enjoy today</div>
<div>Today, experts tell us that we're in a race against time to prevent this scenario from unfolding</div>
<div>And so the question we need to be asking ourselves today is, what is the future of this program</div>

<td><div>But I've been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change</div>
<div>I've worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the world's deadliest, unguarded weapons</div>
<div>Now, many of these plans will cost money, which is why I've laid out how I'll pay for every dime - by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that don't help America grow</div>
<div>So I've got news for you, John McCain</div>
<div>Because I've seen it</div>
<div>Because I've lived it</div>
<div>I've seen it in Illinois, when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>And I've seen it in this campaign</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>And ever since I met this frail, one-hundred-and-five-year-old African-American woman who had found the strength to leave her house and come to a rally because she believed that her voice mattered, I've thought about all she's seen in her life</div>
<div>I've thought about the fact that when she was born, there weren't cars on the road, and no airplanes in the sky</div>
<div>I've thought about how she lived to see a world war and a Great Depression and a second world war, and how she saw her brothers and uncles and nephews and cousins coming home from those wars and still have to sit at the back of a bus</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I've had enough of the closed-door deals that give billions to the HMOs when we're told that we can't do a thing for the 45 million uninsured or the millions more who can't pay their medical bills</div>
<div>I've had enough of being told that we can't afford body armor for our troops and health care for our veterans and benefits for the wounded heroes who've risked their lives for this country</div>
<div>I've had enough of that</div>
<div>I've had enough of giving billions away to the oil companies when we're told that we can't invest in the renewable energy that will create jobs and lower gas prices and finally free us from our dependence on the oil wells of Saudi Arabia</div>
<div>I've had enough of our kids going to schools where the rats outnumber the computers</div>
<div>I've had enough of Katrina survivors living out of their cars and begging FEMA for trailers</div>
<div>And I've had enough of being told that all we can do about this is sit and wait and hope that the good fortune of a few trickles on down to everyone else in this country</div>
<div>I've often thought about Mireya and her simple dream and all those before her who've shared that dream too</div>
<div>And I've wondered - if she is lucky enough to live as long as 105-year-old Marguerite Lewis, if she someday has the chance to look back across the twenty-first century, what will she see</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>

<div>For that is our unyielding faith - that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it</div>
<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship, restoring our sense of common purpose, and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change</div>
<div>By ourselves, this change will not happen</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>And next week, we'll also hear about those occasions when he's broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need</div>
<div>I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a ten percent chance on change</div>
<div>It's time for us to change America</div>
<div>That's the change we need right now</div>
<div>So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President</div>
<div>Change means a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it</div>
<div>Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws, so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses; and the time to protect Social Security for future generations</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear proliferation; poverty and genocide; climate change and disease</div>
<div>Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each other's character and patriotism</div>
<div>You have shown what history teaches us - that at defining moments like this one, the change we need doesn't come from Washington</div>
<div>Change comes to Washington</div>
<div>Change happens because the American people demand it - because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership, a new politics for a new time</div>
<div>I believe that as hard as it will be, the change we need is coming</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>And I know that the vast majority of people in this country desperately want to change this</div>
<div>This coalition succeeded by promising change, and their early gestures - the dismissal of the shaky judges, the renewed vigor of the investigation into the Goldenberg scandal, the calls for real disclosure of elected officials' personal wealth - were all promising</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>

<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>Because we've always fought to bring all of our people under the blanket of the American Dream</div>
<div>And as a result, we've seen families work harder for less and our jobs go overseas</div>
<div>We've seen the cost of health care and child care and gasoline skyrocket</div>
<div>We've seen our children leave for Iraq and terrorists threaten to finish the job they started on 9/11</div>
<div>Because I think we've all had enough</div>
<div>We know that we've been called in churches and mosques, synagogues and Sunday schools to love our neighbors as ourselves; to be our brother's keeper; to be our sister's keeper</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>We've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former Soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market</div>
<div>Fortunately, however, we've made some good progress on this front</div>
<div>But we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from Africa to Afghanistan</div>
<div>Additionally, in the last few years, we've seen some disturbing trends from Russia itself - the deterioration of democracy and the rule of law, the abuses that have taken place in Chechnya, Russian meddling in the former Soviet Union - that raise serious questions about our relationship</div>

<div>What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics - the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough decisions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems</div>
<div>We're distracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants</div>

<div>On November 4th, we must stand up and say: "Eight is enough."
Now let there be no doubt</div>
<div>And Democrats, we must also admit that fulfilling America's promise will require more than just money</div>
<div>Kennedy called our "intellectual and moral strength." Yes, government must lead on energy independence, but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient</div>
<div>Yes, we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair</div>
<div>But we must also admit that programs alone can't replace parents; that government can't turn off the television and make a child do her homework; that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need</div>
<div>And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home, so must we keep America's promise abroad</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead</div>
<div>At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future</div>
<div>Whether it's the war or Katrina or their health care or their jobs, you hear people say that we've finally arrived at a moment where something must change</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>But, Kenya must do its part</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>Everyone has a role to play, and everyone must accelerate this involvement</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>

<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>

<div>For my part, I would suggest three important elements that should be included in such a discussion</div>

<div>In the years ahead, this should become an increasing priority for the Nunn-Lugar program, the Congress, and the Russians, who are already taking important steps to help implement these programs</div>
<div>Additional steps should also be taken to consolidate and secure dangerous pathogen collections, strengthen bio-reconnaissance networks to provide early warning of bio-attack and natural disease outbreaks, and have our experts work together to develop improved medical countermeasures</div>
<div>This does not mean that we should ease up one bit on issues affecting our national security</div>
<div>It means that the Russians can and should do more to support these programs</div>

<div>I became a civil rights lawyer, and taught constitutional law, and after a time, I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate</div>
<div>It is because men and women of every race, from every walk of life, continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest, that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together, as one people - as Americans</div>
<div>After all, every four years, candidates from both parties make similar promises, and I expect this year will be no different</div>
<div>But too many times, after the election is over, and the confetti is swept away, all those promises fade from memory, and the lobbyists and the special interests move in, and people turn away, disappointed as before, left to struggle on their own</div>
<div>This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio, on the brink of retirement, finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work</div>
<div>The truth is, on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives - on health care and education and the economy - Senator McCain has been anything but independent</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune 500, but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business, or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job - an economy that honors the dignity of work</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down, I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed</div>
<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time</div>
<div>I've seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs, in the soldiers who re-enlist after losing a limb, in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise</div>
<div>And after consulting with these higher powers, I threw my hat in the ring and I did what every person on a campaign does - I talked to anyone who'd listen</div>
<div>And when she finally she saw hope breaking through the horizon in the Civil Rights Movement, she thought, "Maybe it's my turn."
And in that movement, she saw women who were willing to walk instead of ride the bus after a day of doing somebody else's laundry and looking after somebody else's children because they walked for freedom</div>
<div>Four years after 9/11, I've had enough of being told that we can find the money to give Paris Hilton more tax cuts, but we can't find enough to protect our ports or our railroads or our chemical plants or our borders</div>
<div>I discovered the beauty of the land, a beauty that haunts you long after you've left</div>
<div>Congress has seen a representative resign after taking bribes, and several others fall under investigation for using their public office for private gain</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>

<div>Now, let me say this - I don't think that George Bush is a bad man</div>
<div>I think he loves his country</div>
<div>I don't think this administration is full of stupid people - I think there are a lot of smart folks in there</div>
<div>The reason they don't believe government has a role in solving national problems is because they think government is the problem</div>
<div>Because I think that this is our moment to lead</div>
<div>I don't have all the solutions or think that they'll be easy, but there are a few places that a country truly committed to reform could start</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>For any of these efforts that I've mentioned to work as we move forward, we must also think critically and strategically about Washington's relationship with Moscow</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>
<div>But, when I think about what is at stake I am reminded by a quote from the late President Kennedy given in a speech at American University in 1963 about threats posed by the Soviet Union</div>

<div>For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight</div>
<div>Let's make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement</div>
<div>Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey, and especially the one who traveled the farthest - a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours -- Hillary Rodham Clinton</div>
<div>Tonight, more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less</div>

A nation of whiners</div>
<div>These are the Americans that I know</div>
<div>Now, I don't believe that Senator McCain doesn't care what's going on in the lives of Americans</div>
<div>How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans</div>
<div>The Bush-McCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans -- Democrats and Republicans - have built, and we are here to restore that legacy</div>
<div>And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream</div>
<div>These are Americans who still believe in an America where anything's possible - they just don't think their leaders do</div>
<div>These are Americans who still dream big dreams -they just sense their leaders have forgotten how</div>
<div>And she knew that during those moments in history where it looked like we might give up hope or settle for less, there have always been Americans who refused</div>
<div>Americans know this</div>
<div>Let it be said that we are the party of affordable, accessible health care for all Americans</div>
<div>The party that won't make Americans choose between a health care plan that bankrupts the government and one that bankrupts families</div>
<div>Because in the end, we may be proud Democrats, but we are prouder Americans</div>

<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>John McCain likes to say that he'll follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell - but he won't even go to the cave where he lives</div>
<div>And today, as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration, even after we learned that Iraq has a $79 billion surplus while we're wallowing in deficits, John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war</div>
<div>If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy, that is his choice - but it is not the change we need</div>
<div>And in the weeks ahead, I look forward to debating them with John McCain</div>

<td><div>In a century just six years old, our faith has been shaken by war and terror, disaster and despair, threats to the middle-class dream, and scandal and corruption in our government</div>
<div>One that serves its people and is free from corruption</div>
<div>It is being threatened by corruption</div>
<div>Corruption is not a new problem</div>
<div>But while corruption is a problem we all share, here in Kenya it is a crisis - a crisis that's robbing an honest people of the opportunities they have fought for - the opportunity they deserve</div>
<div>It is painfully obvious that corruption stifles development - it siphons off scarce resources that could improve infrastructure, bolster education systems, and strengthen public health</div>
<div>In fact, one recent survey showed that corruption in Kenya costs local firms 6% of their revenues, the difference between good-paying jobs in Kenya or somewhere else</div>
<div>And corruption also erodes the state from the inside out, sickening the justice system until there is no justice to be found, poisoning the police forces until their presence becomes a source of insecurity rather than comfort</div>
<div>Corruption has a way of magnifying the very worst twists of fate</div>
<div>What's worse - corruption can also provide opportunities for those who would harness the fear and hatred of others to their agenda and ambitions</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>Some of the worst actors on the international stage can also take advantage of the collective exhaustion and outrage that people feel with official corruption, as we've seen with Islamic extremists who promise purification, but deliver totalitarianism</div>
<div>Endemic corruption opens the door to this kind of movement, and in its wake comes a new set of distortions and betrayals of public trust</div>
<div>And this is why the struggle against corruption is one of the great struggles of our time</div>
<div>Willingness to report corruption is increasingly significantly in Kenya</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>Clarifying these rules and focusing resources on building a judicial system that can enforce them and resolve disputes should be a primary goal of any government suffering from corruption</div>
<div>Of course, in the end, one of the strongest weapons your country has against corruption is the ability of you, the people, to stand up and speak out about the injustices you see</div>
<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>

<div>To Chairman Dean and my great friend Dick Durbin; and to all my fellow citizens of this great nation;
With profound gratitude and great humility, I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States</div>
<div>We meet at one of those defining moments - a moment when our nation is at war, our economy is in turmoil, and the American promise has been threatened once more</div>
<div>And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners."
A nation of whiners</div>
<div>Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan, I see my grandfather, who signed up after Pearl Harbor, marched in Patton's Army, and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill</div>
<div>That's the promise of America - the idea that we are responsible for ourselves, but that we also rise or fall as one nation; the fundamental belief that I am my brother's keeper; I am my sister's keeper</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>This country of ours has more wealth than any nation, but that's not what makes us rich</div>
<div>And how she watched FDR lift this nation out of fear and send millions to college on the GI Bill and lift millions out of poverty with Social Security</div>
<div>She saw four little girls die in a Sunday school and catalyze a nation</div>
<div>Yes, our greatness as a nation has depended on individual initiative, on a belief in the free market</div>
<div>A while ago, I was reading through Jonathan Kozol's new book, Shame of a Nation, which tells of his travels to underprivileged schools across America</div>
<div>In many ways, he embodied the new Africa of the early Sixties, a man who had obtained the knowledge of the Western world, and sought to bring it back home, where he hoped he could help create a new nation</div>
<div>Kenya was also forced to rapidly move from a highly agrarian to a more urban, industrialized nation</div>
<div>This means that the education and health care systems - issues that my own nation more than 200 years old still struggles with - lag behind, impacting its development</div>
<div>They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment </div>

<div>I saw that the problems people faced weren't simply local in nature - that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives; that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away; and that when a child turns to violence, there's a hole in his heart no government could ever fill</div>
<div>I made lasting friendships here - friends that I see in the audience today</div>
<div>That's why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families, and that's why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never, ever be passed</div>
<div>We've made some progress already</div>
<div>To President Clinton, who last night made the case for change as only he can make it; to Ted Kennedy, who embodies the spirit of service; and to the next Vice President of the United States, Joe Biden, I thank you</div>
<div>He said that our economy has made "great progress" under this President</div>
<div>Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who, after they found out it was closing, kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever, because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made</div>
<div>The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great - a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>You know, you probably never thought you'd hear this at a Take Back America conference, but Newt Gingrich made a great point a few weeks ago</div>
<div>He was talking about what an awful job his own party has done governing this country, and he said that with all the mistakes and misjudgments the Republicans have made over the last six years, the slogan for the Democrats should come down to just two words:
Had enough</div>
<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>
<div>And so we know that there is more work to be done - more reforms to be made</div>
<div>I know from these stories that my father was not a perfect man - that he made his share of mistakes and disappointed his share of people in his lifetime</div>
<div>And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal </div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>The Department of Energy and others have certainly made progress in converting civilian reactors to low-enriched uranium, taking back spent fuel, and closing unnecessary facilities</div>

<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>

<div>The world has changed</div>
<div>But while the world has changed around us, too often our government has stood still</div>
<div>And it's the easiest thing in the world</div>

<div>The world knows the names of Wangari Maathai and John Githongo, who are fighting against the insidious corruption that has weakened Kenya</div>
<div>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom</div>

<div>Some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed</div>

<div>But I will also go through the federal budget, line by line, eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less - because we cannot meet twenty-first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy</div>
<div>And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future</div>
<div>I've seen it in Washington, when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable, to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands</div>
<div>Instead, it is that American spirit - that American promise - that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain; that binds us together in spite of our differences; that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen, but what is unseen, that better place around the bend</div>
<div>That we're better off if we dismantle it - if we divvy it up into individual tax breaks, hand 'em out, and encourage everyone to go buy your own health care, your own retirement security, your own child care, their own schools, your own private security force, your own roads, their own levees..</div>

<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>
<div>And that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former Soviet Union represent the greatest threat to the security of the United States - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come</div>
<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>With the situation in Russia and the rest of the former Soviet Union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come</div>
<div>Yet, a serious threat still remains</div>
<div>In a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>But because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the Soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat</div>
<div>One of the most important steps is for Russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat</div>
<div>But when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the U.S.-Russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where Russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started</div>

<div>Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world-class education, because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy</div>
<div>Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save</div>

<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>

<div>But for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither Kenya nor the African continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to HIV/AIDS or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict</div>

<div>It's not just a Kenyan problem, or an African problem</div>
<div>Terrorist attacks - like those that have shed Kenyan blood and struck at the heart of the Kenyan economy - are facilitated by customs and border officers who can be paid off, by police forces so crippled by corruption that they do not protect the personal safety of Kenyans walking the streets of Nairobi, and by forged documents that are easy to find in a climate where graft and fraud thrive</div>
<div>The Kenyan media has been courageous in uncovering and reporting on some of the most blatant abuses of the system, and there has been a growing recognition among people and politicians that this is a critical issue</div>
<div>Today, we're starting to see that the Kenyan people want more than a simple changing of the guard, more than piecemeal reforms to a crisis that's crippling their country</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are crying out for real change, and whether one voted orange or banana in last year's referendum, the message that many Kenyans seemed to be sending was one of dissatisfaction with the pace of reform, and real frustration with continued tolerance of corruption at high levels</div>
<div>In addition, we know that the more information the public is provided, the easier it will be for your Kenyan brothers and sisters out in the villages to evaluate whether they are being treated fairly by their public servants or not</div>
<div>The Kenyan people are the ultimate guardians against abuses</div>
<div>As well as numerous Kenyan men and women who have refused to pay bribes to get civil servants to perform their duties; the auditors and inspectors general who have done the job before them accurately and fairly, regardless of where the facts have led; the journalists who asked questions and pushed for answers when it may have been more lucrative to look the other way, or whip up a convenient fiction</div>
<div>And then there are anonymous Kenyan whistleblowers who show us what is, so that we can all work together to demand what should be</div>
<div>By rejecting the insulting idea that corruption is somehow a part of Kenyan culture, these heroes reveal the very opposite - they reveal a strength and integrity of character that can build a great country, a great future</div>

<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>

<div>For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after 9/11, I stood up and opposed this war, knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face</div>

<div>As a Senator from the United States, I believe that my country, and other nations, have an obligation and self-interest in being full partners with Kenya and with Africa</div>
<div>As some of you know, Senator Lugar and I recently traveled to Russia, Ukraine, and Azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead</div>
<div>He looked at me and said, "Been there, done that."
Of course, Dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the Cooperative Threat Reduction Programs he co-founded with Senator Sam Nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former Soviet Union after the Cold War</div>

<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>

<div>Fortunately, the success of Cooperative Threat Reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this</div>
<div>I want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs</div>
<div>And the Kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in Ukraine, Dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program</div>
<div>One way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the Russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the Cooperative Threat Reduction effort</div>
<div>We also need to ensure that the Cooperative Threat Reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner</div>

<div>And for the sake of our economy, our security, and the future of our planet, I will set a clear goal as President: in ten years, we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East</div>
<div>When John McCain said we could just "muddle through" in Afghanistan, I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11, and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights</div>
<div>As Commander-in-Chief, I will never hesitate to defend this nation, but I will only send our troops into harm's way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home</div>
<div>And the way to create good jobs is when the rules of a society are transparent - when there's a clear and advertised set of laws and regulations regarding how to start a business, what it takes to own property, how to go about getting a loan - there is less of a chance that some corrupt bureaucrat will make up his own rules that suit only his interests</div>
<div>In each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the American people </div>
<div>Now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Dick Lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip</div>
